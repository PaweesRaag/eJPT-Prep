# 🔐 GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) — Explained Simply

GRC is a framework that organizations use to ensure their security, business processes, and legal obligations are aligned.

Think of it as the management side of cybersecurity.

## 1️⃣ Governance — "How we run securely"

### Definition

Governance is the set of rules, policies, and processes that define how an organization operates securely and ethically.

### Includes

- Security policies
- Roles & responsibilities
- Security awareness training
- Decision-making structure
- Incident response planning

### Examples

- Creating an "Acceptable Use Policy"
- Defining who can access what
- Setting up a Security Operations Committee

## 2️⃣ Risk Management — "What can go wrong?"

### Definition

Risk Management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and reducing risks to acceptable levels.

### Steps

1. Identify Risks (Vulnerabilities, threats, failures)
2. Analyze Risks (How likely? How severe?)
3. Prioritize Risks
4. Mitigate Risks (controls, patches, procedures)
5. Monitor

### Example Risks

- Weak passwords
- Ransomware
- Insider threat
- Cloud misconfiguration

### Tools

- Risk register
- CVSS scores
- Vulnerability scanners

## 3️⃣ Compliance — "Are we following the rules?"

### Definition

Compliance ensures the organization is following laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations.

### Examples

- GDPR (privacy)
- HIPAA (healthcare)
- PCI-DSS (card payments)
- ISO 27001 (security framework)
- SOC 2 (service provider security)

### Compliance activities

- Regular audits
- Documentation review
- Evidence collection
- Reporting to regulators

## ⭐ How G, R, and C Work Together

| Part | Questions it answers |
|------|---------------------|
| Governance | What rules and policies should we follow? |
| Risk | What could go wrong and how do we prevent it? |
| Compliance | Are we meeting legal & industry requirements? |

They operate as one integrated system.

## 🔄 GRC Workflow (Easy Flow)

1. **Governance sets policies:** → "Enable MFA, patch systems within 30 days."
2. **Risk Management identifies issues:** → "Legacy servers cannot support MFA. Risk = high."
3. **Compliance checks if obligations are met:** → "MFA is required by ISO 27001 clause A.9.4.2."

Together, they ensure security, business continuity, and legal safety.

## 📌 Why GRC Is Important

- Prevents cyber incidents
- Helps avoid fines and lawsuits
- Builds customer trust
- Ensures business stability
- Enables certifications (ISO, SOC2, PCI)

## 🧭 GRC vs Traditional Cybersecurity

| GRC | Technical Cybersecurity |
|-----|------------------------|
| Policies & processes | Firewalls, SIEM, exploit prevention |
| Risk assessments | Penetration testing |
| Compliance | Hardening systems |
| Reporting | Incident response |

GRC is management/strategic, while cybersecurity is operational/technical.

## 🧨 Real-World Example of GRC

**Scenario:** Company stores customer credit cards.

- **Governance:** → Create policies for handling sensitive data.
- **Risk:** → Assess if data can be stolen. → Encrypt database.
- **Compliance:** → Ensure PCI-DSS standards are met. → Maintain audit logs.

# 🔥 What is Lynis?

Lynis is an open-source security auditing tool for:
- Linux
- macOS
- Unix-based systems
- Cloud instances
- Containers

It performs in-depth security scans and gives:
- Hardening suggestions
- Vulnerability findings
- Compliance checks
- System misconfigurations
- Audit, logging, and security control issues

Lynis is used heavily in:
- Security auditing
- Compliance checks (PCI, HIPAA, ISO, NIST)
- Server hardening
- Red teaming (misconfig reconnaissance)
- Blue teaming (baseline health check)

## ⚙️ What Lynis Actually Does Internally

When Lynis runs, it performs many checks such as:

- ✔ Checking installed packages
- ✔ Checking file permissions
- ✔ Checking password policies
- ✔ Checking SSH configurations
- ✔ Checking firewall rules
- ✔ Checking cron jobs
- ✔ Checking running services
- ✔ Checking kernel parameters
- ✔ Checking auditing tools
- ✔ Checking logs & integrity tools
- ✔ Checking malware indicators
- ✔ Checking vulnerable configurations

It's like an automated checklist for securing a Linux system.

## ⭐ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hundreds of security tests | Covers system, malware, network, file permissions, kernel, logging |
| No agents needed | Runs directly on the system |
| Audit & Harden | Gives a score + security recommendations |
| Compliance | Helps map findings to standards like PCI, ISO, NIST |
| Logs everything | `/var/log/lynis.log` |

## 🚀 Install Lynis

### Debian / Ubuntu / Kali:

```bash
sudo apt install lynis -y
```

### Other Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis
cd lynis
sudo ./lynis audit system
```

## 🔍 Basic Usage

### 1️⃣ Full System Audit

```bash
sudo lynis audit system
```

### 2️⃣ Show all available tests

```bash
sudo lynis show tests
```

### 3️⃣ Run compliance mode

```bash
sudo lynis audit system --pentest
```

Perfect for red teamers → only shows weak points.

## 📊 Interpreting the Output

Lynis gives:

### ✔ Warnings

Issues that reduce security → Example: `Warning: SSH root login is allowed`

### ✔ Suggestions

Improvement recommendations → Example: `Suggestion: Install a firewall or enable UFW`

### ✔ Hardening Index

- Out of 100
- Higher = more secure
- Below 60 = weak security

### ✔ Log files

- Detailed log: `/var/log/lynis.log`
- Report summary: `/var/log/lynis-report.dat`

## 🛠️ Common Audit Areas

Lynis evaluates:

### 🔸 1. Authentication

- Password policies
- Root login
- PAM settings

### 🔸 2. File Permissions

- World-writable files
- Incorrect permissions

### 🔸 3. Services & Ports

- Unnecessary services
- Weak configurations

### 🔸 4. Firewall

- iptables / ufw / firewalld status

### 🔸 5. Logging & Monitoring

- rsyslog
- auditd
- log rotation

### 🔸 6. Kernel Security

- sysctl values
- ASLR
- CPU vulnerabilities

### 🔸 7. Malware & Integrity

- ClamAV
- chkrootkit
- AIDE

## 🎯 Example Commands + Explanations
